# In - Output / Image to Audio
A small web application in which you can play small image maps as audio.

I created this project in under a weeks time as a retake on In-output due to issues with the criteria.

This application uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to generate the sound with it's provided oscillators.  Because I used the oscillators the timing of generated sounds is not always perfect due to the API's limitations.
